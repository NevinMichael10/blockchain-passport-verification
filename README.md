# Blockchain based Digital Passport.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The aim of this project is to develop a simple blockchain based digital passport where, the passport details of the user will be stored on a block. The passport can only be viewed if the user shares the hash of the block. The project is developed on Etherium blockchain.\

## Technology Stack

**Front End :** `React.js`\
**Backend :** `Node.js`\
**Blockchain :** `Ethereum`\
**Node Provider :** `Infura`\
**Ethereum development environment :** `Hardhat`\
**JavaScript library :** `Ethers.js`\

### Installing Dependencies
Go to the project directory and run the below command on cmd.\
`npm install`\
This will install all the required dependencies in the "node modules" folder.
### Run the app
To run the app in the development mode, go to project folder and run the command `npm start`\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
